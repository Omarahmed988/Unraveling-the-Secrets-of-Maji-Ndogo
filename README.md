# ðŸŒŸ Sharing an Incredible Journey! ðŸŒŸ

I'm thrilled to present one of the most impactful projects I've ever undertaken, leveraging the power of SQL and Power BI. Join me as we delve into the transformative story of the Maji Ndogo project, where data analysis became a catalyst for change.

## Project Overview

In Maji Ndogo and communities worldwide, access to clean and reliable water sources is an absolute necessity for daily life. Throughout this project, I collected extensive data on water sources, water collection, and crime, gaining profound insights into the daily lives of residents and the pivotal role water plays in their well-being.

Imagine relying on a few primary water sources, often located far from homes. For many, especially women and children, a significant portion of the day is dedicated to collecting water. This arduous task involves enduring long walks under the scorching sun, carrying heavy containers, and waiting in endless lines at the water sources. The physical and time demands of this chore can be grueling, especially for those juggling work and household responsibilities.

Unfortunately, these limited water sources often become overcrowded, creating tense situations as people compete for access to this precious resource. Such circumstances can lead to disputes and, in some cases, even escalate into criminal activities.

## SQL Phase

In the initial phase with SQL, I embarked on a comprehensive journey, divided into four distinct parts, ultimately converging into a powerful notebook file:

#### Part 1: Data Exploration and Refinement
I delved into Maji Ndogo's extensive database, housing over 60,000 records across multiple tables. Using basic queries, I familiarized myself with the contents of each table while refining some data using DML techniques.

#### Part 2: Deep Data Analysis
The second phase propelled me into a deep analytical dive, exploring Maji Ndogo's water landscape. Armed with a vast array of functions, including intricate window functions, I unearthed valuable insights hidden within the data tables.

#### Part 3: Statistical Analysis and Audit
Continuing the journey, I extracted data from various tables and applied statistical analyses to examine the consequences of an audit report that cross-referenced a random sample of records. This helped shed light on critical patterns and trends.

#### Part 4: Final Insights and Data Preparation
In the final leg of the SQL phase, I brought the data analysis to completion using the full suite of SQL tools. Armed with these final insights, I classified water sources and prepared relevant data for the engineering teams, empowering them to make informed decisions.

## Power BI Phase

But the journey didn't end there! I took the project to the next level by transitioning to Power BI. Let's explore the remarkable accomplishments of the Power BI phase, which also unfolded in four captivating parts:

#### Part 1: Visualizing Survey Results
Introducing updated data on the gender composition of queues at shared water taps in Maji Ndogo, along with new crime-related data. I embarked on creating basic visuals, gradually diving into the crime-related and gender parity data, illustrating the correlation between women queueing and becoming victims of crime. The ultimate goal was to visualize the results of the national survey data, laying the foundation for future reporting.

#### Part 2: Data Modeling and Visualization Refinement
With a focus on data models, I meticulously imported tables, cleaned the data, and established a robust relational data model within Power BI. Leveraging this new data model, I recreated and refined the visuals, customizing text, colors, and fonts to ensure clear and simple communication of the insights.

#### Part 3: Enriching Data Representation
In the third phase, I put the finishing touches on the national survey report. Utilizing the power of DAX, I created measures and columns to enrich our data, ensuring accurate and meaningful representation on the dashboard.

#### Part 4: Building a Public Dashboard
The grand finale! Utilizing all the skills honed throughout the project, I crafted a public dashboard with a mission of transparency. This dashboard became a powerful tool to track the total budget against project completion, monitor team performance, and compare budgeted versus actual costs, flagging potential corruption. By promoting transparency and accountability, we aimed to address Maji Ndogo's water crisis head-on.
